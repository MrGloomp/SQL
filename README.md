# SQL Bank Database Project
My SQL project and the largest project I worked on during my time in university was to create a simulation of a bank's database system for my semester's hand in. 
For this project I had to design and then create a databse in SQL Server which contained information about clients (Customer, Card, Account [Savings or Checking], and Location) as well as information about purchases they made with their cards (Transaction, Location, Shop and Payment).
After the daabase was done and filled with demo data, we were to write Queries that would fetch specific information from the SQL database.
As a final step, we had to integrate a programming language (my choice was Python) and use it to access the SQL server and fetch data from it.
